Employment
----------

**Software Engineer at Tweag I/O**

I have been working as a Haskell consultant at [Tweag I/O][tweag] since
September 2016. I have lead projects from when they were moonshots to
production-ready products.

* I was part of the research team for an [EU-funded project][sage] which aimed
  at redefining data storage for the era of extreme data and exascale
  computing.
* I was one of only two developers who created an entirely new data platform
  for a Fortune 500 company. To this day, the platform enables data scientists
  from several continents to easily share large datasets for reproducible
  research.
* I am currently a core developer of a new form of spreadsheet engine, which
  allows Python, R and other programming languages to be used interactively
  alongside Excel. I have advised on, and helped implementing the API and
  database designs, auto scaling infrastructure and code quality measures.

**Platform Engineer at Pusher Ltd.**

I worked at [Pusher Ltd.](https://pusher.com) in London from September 2015 to
July 2016. One of my key lessons at the job was that with every million users
comes a million ways to break a platform.

* I contributed to the design and development of a high-performance,
  distributed PubSub system.
* I developed a pluggable system for monitoring and reporting the performance
  of the platform.
* I wrote `nagios-sink`, a simple service that gathers the statuses of Nagios
  endpoints.

Technical Experience
--------------------

Open Source
:   I contribute to the Open Source projects that I use in my work regularly,
    either to bring attention to an issue, to directly fix a bug, or to submit
    new features. In addition, I maintain a few projects of my own, including:

    * [stutter][stutter] -- A command-line tool that generates strings
      based on regex-like input.
    * [rulex][rulex] -- A Ruby DSL for generating LaTeX.
    * [mask][mask] -- the Haskell Makefile parser and generator.

Tools
:   **Haskell** is my language of choice for most projects. I have learned to
    leverage its powerful type system on many occasions, have contributed to
    core libraries, and have a good understanding of its runtime
    characteristics.

:   **Nix** is my go-to package manager and build system. I contribute to
    Nixpkgs, have deployed Nix in production to teams of up to 40 engineers and
    have acquired an excellent understanding of its model, capabilities and
    limitations.

:   I am proficient with **Go**, **Java**, **Ruby**, **C/C++**, **Kubernetes**
    and **Terraform**.

:   I have a basic knowledge of **Rust**, **Python**, **JavaScript**,
    **Erlang**, **LaTeX** and **x86 assembly**
