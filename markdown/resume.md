Employment
----------

**Software Engineer at Tweag I/O**

I have been working as a Haskell consultant with [Tweag I/O][tweag] since
September 2016. I was acting directly with clients and learned how to turn
moonshots into production-ready projects.

* I was part of the research team for an [EU-funded project][sage] which aims
  at redefining data storage for the era of extreme data and exascale
  computing, and
* I was on a two-man mission for developing a new data platform for a Fortune
  500 company; the platform enables data scientists from several continents to
  easily share large datasets for reproducible research, and
* I worked on a spreadsheet engine that allows Python, R and other
  languages to be used interactively alongside Excel. I advised on, and helped
  implementing the API and database designs, auto scaling infrastructure and
  code quality measures.

**Platform Engineer at Pusher Ltd.**

I worked at [Pusher Ltd.](https://pusher.com) in London for a year starting in
September 2015. This taught me that with every million users come a million
ways to break your platform.

* I contributed to the design and development of a high-performance,
  distributed PubSub system, and
* I developed a pluggable system for reporting and monitoring the performance of
  the platform, and
* I wrote `nagios-sink`, a simple service that gathers the statuses of Nagios
  endpoints.

Technical Experience
--------------------

Open Source
:   I often contribute to the Open Source projects that I use in my work,
    either to bring attention to an issue -- or directly fix a bug -- or to
    submit a new feature. I also have a few projects of my own, including:

    * [stutter][stutter] -- A command-line tool that generates strings
      based on regex-like input,
    * [rulex][rulex] -- A Ruby DSL for generating LaTeX, and
    * [mask][mask] -- the Haskell Makefile parser and generator.

Tools
:   **Haskell** is my language of choice for most projects. I have leveraged
    its powerful type system on many occasions, have contributed to core
    libraries and have a good understanding of its runtime characteristics.

:   **Nix** is my go-to package manager and build system. I contribute to
    Nixpkgs, have deployed Nix in production to team to up to 40 engineers and
    have acquired an excellent understanding of its model, capabilities and
    limitations.

:   Proficient with **Go**, **Java**, **Ruby**, **C/C++**, **Kubernetes**, **Terraform**

:   Basic knowledge of **Rust**, **Erlang**, **LaTeX**, **x86 assembly**,
    **JavaScript**, **Python**
